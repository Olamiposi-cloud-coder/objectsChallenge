# JavaScript Objects Coding Challenge

## Description
This coding challenge focuses on JavaScript objects and methods. The objective was to create two objects, each representing a person, with properties including `firstName`, `lastName`, `mass`, and `height`. Additionally, a method named `calcBMI` was to be implemented in each object to calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) based on the provided formula. Finally, a comparison between the BMIs of the two individuals was to be logged to the console using a specific string format.

## Challenge Details
1. Create two JavaScript objects, each representing a person, with properties:
   - `firstName`
   - `lastName`
   - `mass` (in kilograms)
   - `height` (in meters)
2. Implement a method named `calcBMI` within each object to calculate the BMI using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height)
3. Use an if/else statement to compare the BMIs of the two individuals.
4. Log a message to the console indicating whose BMI is higher, following the format:
"{firstName} {lastName}'s BMI ({calculatedBMI}) is higher than {firstName} {lastName}'s BMI ({calculatedBMI})."


## Example Output
For example, if the calculated BMIs for two individuals were:
- John Miller: BMI = 24.5
- Mark Smith: BMI = 23.4
The output logged to the console should be: "John Miller's BMI (24.5) is higher than Mark Smith's BMI (23.4)."

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Olamiposi-cloud-coder/objectsChallenge.git 

2. Open the index.js file and review the implementation of the objects and methods.
3. Run the code to see the comparison of BMIs logged to the console.
